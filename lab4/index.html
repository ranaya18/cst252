	<h1> Lab 4: Pseudocoding and Problem-Solving </h1>
	<p> Learing how to pseudocode before coding.</p>

			<h1> Challenges </h1>
			<p> The biggest challenge for me is that I wasn't sure if I was writing
				the pseudocode right. It was a bit confusing as to how to word the game we
			  were breaking down into steps using the pseudocoding.</p>

			<h1> Problems </h1>
			<p> The only problem I had was the terminalogy I was suppose to use when
					breaking down the game and if I was suppose to add the pseudocode steps
					to the top of every step.</p>

			<h1> Results </h1>
			<p> I honestly don't know if I did any of it right but it looks right to me.</p>
