 		<p> Hello, my name is Raeann Anaya. I am 22 years old, I was born in Grand
 			Junction, Colorado but grew up in Merced, California. I am a movie buff, I
			could sit in front of the tv for hours. So much so that I want to abtain a
			career in the movie business in hopes of creating animation mvoies or video
			game settings for varies companies one day. I also love to play Sudoku, I
			refuse to play a game if it is not extremely difficult, I have been playing
			it for as long as I can remember. Fun fact, I actully won the Dominoes
			tournament my first year at CSUMB. I also have an Associates Degree in
			Studio Art and in Art History. </p>
