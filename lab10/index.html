      <h3>Challenges</h3>
      <p>I didn't really face any challenges in this lab. Since I did miss
      class the day this was taught, it was confusing at first but I was able to
      understand it quickly. </p>

      <h3>Problems</h3>
      <p>The code that I input worked successfully so I didn't face any problems
        in this lab.</p>

      <h3>Results</h3>
      <p>The page worked, everything uploaded correctly.</p>
