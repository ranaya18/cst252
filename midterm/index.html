                        <p>Cons Libras do not like confrontation or discomfort. For the sake of peacekeeping, they will not express their anger or discomfort, but if they are not careful, this can lead to suppressed emotions that can solidify into resentment. Later on, this resentment may come out in unusual ways, as Libraâ€™s Venusian tendency to focus only on the good and pleasant will put their more uncomfortable feelings off of their radar.</p>
