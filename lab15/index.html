  <h3>Challenges</h3>
  <p>I had a few challenges with this lab, it was a bit confusng for me and the
  class activity barely helped.</p>

  <h3>Problems</h3>
  <p>The code that I put into JavaScript didn't seem to work in the end.</p>

  <h3>Results</h3>
  <p>This lab was unseccessful and wasn't able to get my code to work.</p>

  <h3>Output</h3>

  <p>Display "Good day!" if the hour is less than 18:00:</p>

  <p id="w3">Good Evening!</p>

  <script>
  if (new Date().getHours() < 18) {
    document.getElementById("w3").innerHTML = "Good day!";
  }
  </script>
