	<h2> Raeann Anaya </h2>
		<p> Hello, I am Raeann Anaya and I'm a senior here at CSUMB. I transferred here with two
			AA degrees in Studio Art and in Art History. I initially got into CSUMB to
		study Cinema Arts and Technology but had to switch to Communication Design to be
		more hands on with computers. </p>

		<h3> Matthew Lencioni </h3>

				from Santa Clara, CA. I took CST251 last semseter, so I am semi-familiar
				with Html & Css, but I am completely new to JavaScript.I am eager to see
				where this class will take my design! My hobbies include: Photography,
				Karaoke, and Hammocking.</p>
